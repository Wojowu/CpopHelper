# Cpop Helper
This is my first "real" programming project, adding a bunch of new triggers and entities into Celeste. Those are mostly intended for use in personal projects, but as they might end up useful to others, I am putting them into a public helper.

My coding skills are beyond terrible, so I apologize for anyone who dares look at the code. Feel free to reuse the code, as long as you credit appropriately. Use at your own risk.

All feedback is welcome and appreciated, including suggestions or feature requests (always open for ideas, can't promise I will implement them), or feedback on the code (I am unlikely to rewrite existing code unless it breaks, but I am happy to learn more)

## Huge Thanks
 - to Vividescence, for encouragement in starting this project.
 - to Kalobi, SSM24, Microlith57, XMinty7, and various other members of Celeste Discord, for technical help.
 - to Vickyy, for (jokingly) suggesting the name.
